\section{What is a category}

\subsection{Definition of a category}
 
\subsection{Examples of categories}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Poset}. A poset (partially ordered set) is a set $P$ with a binary
    relation $\leq$ that satisfies reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transivity.
    Any poset forms a category where the elements of the category are the
    objects of $P$ and where for two objects $a$ and $b$ there is an arrow from
    $a$ to $b$ iff. $a \leq b$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Commutative diagrams}

Wikipedia has the following thing to say about commutative diagrams.

\begin{displayquote}
  In mathematics, and especially in category theory, a commutative diagram is a
  diagram such that all directed paths in the diagram with the same start and
  endpoints lead to the same result. Commutative diagrams play the role in
  category theory that equations play in algebra.
\end{displayquote}

When we draw a diagram like the following.
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
  A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[d, "h"']
  & B \arrow[d, "g"] \\
  C \arrow[r, "p"] & D
\end{tikzcd}
\]
It is supposed to communicate that $f \circ g = h \circ p$. In such cases we say
the ``the diagram commutes'' to denote the properties that the diagram indicates
that the arrows have.

\section{Monomorphism and epimorphism}

\subsection{Monomorphism}

\begin{definition}{Monomorphism}
  In a category $\bf{C}$, an arrow $\arr{f}{A}{B}$ is a \emph{monomorphism} if for
  any $g, h : C \rightarrow A$ it is the case that $fg = fh \implies g = h$.
  \[
  \begin{tikzcd}
    C \ar[r, shift left, "g"] \ar[r, shift right, "h"'] & A \arrow[r, "f"] & B
  \end{tikzcd}
  \]
\end{definition}

A monomorphism is also called a \emph{mono} and it is said to be \emph{monic}.

Mnemonic: A monomorphism is the categorical equivalent to an \emph{injective}
function, that is a one-to-one function, and \emph{mono} means \emph{one}.

\begin{proposition}
  A function $\arr{f}{A}{B}$ between sets is monic in $\bf{Sets}$ if and only if
  it is injective.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  ($\Rightarrow$) Assume $f$ is a monomorphism in $\bf{Sets}$. We must show that
  $f$ is an injective function. Let $a, a' \in A$ where $a \neq a'$. We are done
  if we can show that $f(a) \neq f(a')$.
  
  ($\Leftarrow$) Assume $f$ is an injective function. We must show that $f$ is a
  monomorphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}{Epimorphism}
  In a category $\bf{C}$, an arrow $\arr{f}{A}{B}$ is an \emph{epimorphism} if
  for any $\arr{i, j}{B}{D}$ it is the case that $if = jf \implies i = j$.

  \begin{tikzcd}
    A \ar[r, "f"] & B \ar[r, shift left, "i"] \ar[r, shift right, "j"'] & D
  \end{tikzcd}

  An epimorphism is said to be \emph{epic}.
\end{definition}
    
\begin{proposition}
  A function $\arr{f}{A}{B}$ between sets is an epimorphism in $\bf{Sets}$ if
  and only if it is injective.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  ($\Rightarrow$) Assume $f$ is an epimorphism. We must show that $f$ is a
  surjective function. Let $b$ be an element in $B$. Let $d, d' \in D$ where $d
  \neq d'$ and define $\arr{i}{B}{D}$ as the function that maps every element
  in $B$ to $d$ except for $b$ which it maps to $d'$.
  \[
    i(x) = \begin{cases}
      d' & x = b \\
      d & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \]
  Let $\arr{j}{B}{D}$ be a constant function that sends every element to $d$.
  \[
    j(x) = d
  \]
  Since $i \neq j$ we have $if \neq jf$. Thus there exists some $a \in A$ where
  $i(f(a)) \neq j(f(a))$. But $i$ and $j$ are equal for all arguments except
  $b$. Hence $f(a) = b$. Since $b$ was arbitrary this shows that $f$ is
  surjective.

  ($\Leftarrow$) Assume that $f$ is a surjective function. We must show that $f$
  is an epimorphism. Let $\arr{i, j}{B}{D}$ be arbitrary functions where $i \neq
  j$. Then there exists some $b \in B$ where $i(b) \neq j(b)$. Since $f$ is
  surjective there must exist an $a \in A$ where $b = f(a)$. Putting this
  together we have:

  \begin{align*}
    i(b) &\neq j(b) && \text{since $i \neq j$} \\
    i(f(a)) &\neq j(f(a)) && \text{from how we defined $b$}
  \end{align*}

  Therefore $if \neq jf$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
  In a poset category all arrows are both monic and epic.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\arr{f}{A}{B}$ be an arrow in a poset category. Per the definition of a
  poset category there is always only a single arrow between two objects.
  Therefore if we have $\arr{g, h}{C}{A}$ such that $fg = fh$ we can conclude
  that $g = h$ since they are both arrows between $C$ and $A$. Therefore $f$ is
  monic. Similarly, if $\arr{i, j}{B}{D}$ such that $if = jf$ then $i = j$ and
  $f$ is a epic.
\end{proof}

\section{Products}

\begin{lemma}
  Products are unique up to isomorphism. That is, if $A \times B$ and $A' \times
  B'$ are products in a category $\bf{C}$ then.
  $$
  A \times B \cong A' \times B'
  $$
\end{lemma}

The above theorem tells us that all products are the same except for unimportant
details.
